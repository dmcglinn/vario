Description: This package computes the spatial community variograms first 
developed in Wagner (Ecology, 2003) and further described in McGlinn and Hurlbert 
(in prep). Additionally code is provided to carry out null model analysis to 
examine if the spatial patterns differ from chance expectation.  McGlinn and 
Hurlbert (submitted) fully describe the null models implemented here.  Lastly this 
package provides graphical helper functions for examining the results.

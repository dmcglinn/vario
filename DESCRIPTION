Title: Compute multivariate community variograms, carry out null models, and graph results
Author: Dan McGlinn
Maintainer: Dan McGlinn <danmcglinn@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), vegan
Description: This package computes the spatial community variograms first developed in Wagner (Ecology, 2003) and further described in McGlinn and Hurlbert (Oikos, submitted). Additionally code is provided to carry out null model analysis to examine if the spatial patterns differ from chance expectation.  McGlinn and Hurlbert (submitted) fully describe the null models implemented here.  Lastly this package provides graphical helper functions for examining the results.
